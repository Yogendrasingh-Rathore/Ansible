# Setting up RabbitMQ

The RabbitMQ is not available directly in the ubuntu repository, thus we add the repo and then install it.

To install RabbitMQ follow these steps:

1. Install Erlang Repo Package
2. Add an Erlang Solution public key



Note: For adding a repo using ansible we make use of #deb package in apt module
